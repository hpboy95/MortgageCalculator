Introduction
Build a mortgage calculator. 

Mortgage monthly payment calculation:

b.	Down payment
c.	Interest rate
d.	Terms (number of years to pay, must be picked from {15, 20, 25, 30, 40})
e.	Property tax rate
A calculate button triggers the calculation, and a reset button clears all fields. 

2.	Output:

a.	http://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-Mortgage-Payments
b.	To verify that your calculation is correct, use the mortgage calculator provided by http://www.mortgagecalculator.org/ as a reference. Do not model the PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance); i.e., assume it is zero.
Functionality
1.	The main screen should consist of all the necessary properly labeled input fields for the calculation
2.	An output/error message should be shown when the user presses the calculate button
3.	All input/output fields should be cleared for the next calculation when the user presses the reset button

Device & screen size
The assignment will be graded on the Nexus 5 and 10 simulators. Check in these simulators to ensure the image and text are properly sized and aligned. 
Error handling
